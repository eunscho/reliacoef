#' Spearman's (1999)  unidimensional data of six items. The data was collected 
#' from school children in London. This data is historical data from which the 
#' first factor analysis was carried out. Spearman's factor analysis model was 
#' a unidimensional model, but other than this dataset, data that satisfies a 
#' unidimension were uncommon (Hägglund, 2001).
