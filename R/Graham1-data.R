#' Graham's (2006) artificial dataset consisting of five items.This is the 
#' second dataset in his Table 2. The last item is about five times as important 
#' as the other items. This dataset provides a good indication of how sensitive 
#' each reliability coefficient is to the violation of the tau equivalence 
#' assumption. The CFA reliability coefficient presented by the author is .97.
