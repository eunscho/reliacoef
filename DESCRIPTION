Version: 1.0.0
Author: Eunseong Cho <drescho91@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Eunseong Cho <drescho91@gmail.com>
Description: It calculates multiple reliability estimates and compares them with reliability estimates provided by other packages. 
    Unidimensional reliability estimators provided are as follows. coefficient alpha, 
    congeneric reliability, the Gilmer-Feldt coefficient, 
    Feldt's classical congeneric reliability, Hancock's H, Heise-Borhnstedt's Omega, 
    Kaiser-Caffrey's alpha, and Ten Berge and Zegers' mu series. 
    Multidimensional reliablity estimators provided are as follows. stratified alpha, maximal reliability,
    multidimensional parallel reliability, correlated factors reliability, 
    second-order factor reliability, and bifactor reliability.
