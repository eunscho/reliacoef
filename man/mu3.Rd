Obtain Ten Berge and Socan's (2004) mu3.
}
\details{
The original formula and the formula of psych's tenberge() are different.
There is a high possibility that the original formula is incorrect and psych's
version is correct. According to Equation (4) of the original article, mu
should increase monotonically (e.g., mu4>=mu3), but if the original formula is
followed, it may decrease in some cases. The formula of the original paper is
2h, but changing it to 2^h solves this problem. This function follow the latter
interpretation.
